Thank you everyone for showing tremendous interest in the [React series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODKIxaSMgpU&list=PLIJrr73KDmRyrDnDFy-hHvQ24rRjz6e_J). I am glad to know that it is helping many of you. Let's take the learning a step forward. We will
take part in the quizzes and tasks based on all that we are learning in the series. This page will have all the questions and tasks that I post on the [YouTube community page](https://www.youtube.com/c/TapasAdhikary/community).

  Tasks: 
  
  - ✔️ Here is an API URL that gives you a bunch of user information: [https://json-faker.onrender.com/users](https://json-faker.onrender.com/users)
